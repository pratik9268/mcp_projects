An algorithm is an efficient method that can be \\nexpressed within a finite amount of time and space. \\n \\n \\nAn algorithm is the best way to represent the solution of a particular problem in a very simple \\nand efficient way. If we have an algorithm for a specific problem, then we can implement it \\nin any programming language, meaning that the algorithm is independent from any \\nprogramming languages. \\nAlgorithm is like procedure which does somet hing. For example, preparing the dish of food, \\nsome experiment done by the student in physics. Each procedure needs some input and \\nproduce output.  \\nAlgorithms can be expressed as natural languages , programming languages,  pseudocode, \\nflowcharts and control tables. Natural language expressions are rare, as they are more \\nambiguous. Programming languages are normally used for expressing algorithms executed by \\na computer. \\n1.2 What is difference between Algorithm and Program?  \\n \\nAlgorithm Program \\nIt is related to d esigning the solution of a \\nproblem.  \\nIt is related to implementation of solution of \\na problem.  \\nDomain knowledge is required who writes \\nalgorithm.  \\nProgrammer writes it  and also need some \\ndomain knowledge.  \\nIt is written in a ny language – English like \\nlanguage or mathematical notation as long \\nas it is understandable by programmer.  \\nIt is written in any programming languages \\nlike C, C++, Python etc..  \\nIt is independent of hardware and software. It is dependent on hardware and software. \\nWe need to select either Linux or Windows.  \\nAnalysis is performed on the algorithm once \\nit is written.  \\nTesting is performed once it is \\nimplemented.', \"4 | P a g e  \\n \\n1.3  Characteristics of Algorithms \\nThe main characteristics of algorithms are as follows − \\n\\uf0b7 Input – it may or may not take input – 0 or more input.  \\n\\uf0b7 Output – It must produce some output – otherwise no meaning of it. At l east \\none output.  \\n\\uf0b7 Definiteness ( clear/precise)– each statement must be unambiguous means it \\nmust be having clear meaning. For example, we try to find square root of \\nnegative number which is not possible.  \\n\\uf0b7 Finiteness – it must terminate at some point. It is not like running continuously \\nuntil we stop it like web server.  \\n\\uf0b7 Effectiveness – we cannot write statement unnecessarily. It must do something \\nand have some effect. Each operation must be simple and feasible so that one \\ncan trace it out using paper and pencil. While preparing a dish, we don’t do the \\nthings (like cutting vegetables but not used in the dish) which is not part of \\npreparation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Language independent: algorithms must be independent of any language, and \\nthey must be implemented in any language.  \\n \\n1.4  How to write an algorithm? \\nThe algorithm is written without using any language, but it is mostly written in C like \\nlanguage.  \\nAlgorithm swap(a,b) \\nbegin  \\n temp = a \\n a = b \\n b =temp \\nend  \\n \\n1.5 What is analysis of algorithm?  \\nIn computer science, the analysis of algorithms is the process of finding the  computational \\ncomplexity of algorithms —the amount of time, storage, or other resources needed to \\nexecute them . Usually, this involves determining a  function that relates the size of an \\nalgorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its  time complexity ) or the number of \\nstorage locations it uses (its space complexity). \\nAn algorithm is said to be efficient when this function's values are small or  grow slowly \\ncompared to a growth in the size of the input.  \\nDifferent inputs of the same size may cause the algorithm to have different behavior , so best, \\nworst and average case descriptions might all be of practical interest.\", '5 | P a g e  \\nAlgorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity th eory, which provides \\ntheoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific \\ncomputational problem. Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and \\nspace resources required to execute it. \\n1.6  Why Analysis of Algorithms is important? \\n\\uf0b7 In software development, before implementing the software, we first need to prepare the \\ndesign. Without design, it is not possible to make the software. \\n\\uf0b7 When we construct any house then first, we prepare the drawing and then const ruct it. It is \\nnot based on trial and error.  \\nThe following is the importance of analysis of algorithm.  \\n1. To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific \\ncomputer. \\n2. It is much more convenient to have simple measures for the efficiency of an \\nalgorithm than to implement the algorithm and test the efficiency every time a \\ncertain parameter in the underlying computer system changes. \\n3. It is impossible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm. There are too many \\ninfluencing factors. \\n4. The analysis is thus only an approximation; it is not perfect. \\n5. More importantly, by analyzing different algorithms, we can compare them to \\ndetermine the best one for our purpose. \\n \\n1.7  How to analyse an algorithm?  \\nAlgorithm is analysed based on the following parameters:  \\n\\uf0b7 Time: how much time it is taking? time function  \\n\\uf0b7 Space: how much memory space it requires?  \\n\\uf0b7 Network data transfer: how much data it is transferring.  \\n\\uf0b7 Power consumption: as devices are different now a days.  \\n\\uf0b7 CPU register it uses. For ex. When we are writing algorithm for device driver.  \\n \\n1.8 Time and Space analysis:  \\nAlgorithm swap(a,b) \\nbegin  \\n temp = a  - 1 \\n a = b   - 1 \\n b =temp  - 1 \\nend  \\nTime analysis:  \\nThe above algorithm takes 3 units of time so, f(n) = 3 which is O (1).', '6 | P a g e  \\nEach statement takes one unit time as constant.  \\nX = a + 5 * b + c * 9  \\nIn machine, it is done using many instructions, but we don’t consider it. We just see as one \\ninstruction and taking one unit time. It is like going to your friend house no need to do \\nplanning how you will go there but if you have to go to mars then detailed planning is \\nneeded. \\nSpace analysis:  \\nHow much memory space is needed?  \\nIn the above algorithm, S(n) = 3 which is constant. O(1)  \\n \\n1.9 Priori Analysis and Posteriori Analysis:  \\nTime complexity of an algorithm can be calculated by using two methods:   \\n1. Posteriori Analysis  \\n2. Priori Analysis \\n \\nPriori Analysis Posteriori Analysis  \\nAlgorithm Program \\nIndependent of language  Dependent on language  \\nHardware independent Hardware dependent  \\nTime and Space function Watch time and bytes  \\nIt uses asymptotic notation to calculate time \\nand space complexity. \\nIt does not use asymptotic notation to \\ncalculate time and space complexity. \\nThe time complexity of an algorithm using \\na priori analysis is same f or every system.  \\nThe time complexity of an algorithm using \\na posteriori analysis differ from system to \\nsystem. \\nIt is cheaper. It is costlier because it needs hardware and \\nsoftware.  \\nIt is done before execution of an algorithm.  It is done after execution of an algorithm.  \\n \\n1.10 Why analysis of algorithm needed?    \\nAlgorithmic is defined as the study of algorithms. When we set out to solve a problem, there \\nmight be a choice of algorithms available. In this case, it is important to decide which one to \\nuse. Depending on our priorities and on limits of the equipment available to us, we may want \\nto choose the algorithm that takes least time or least storage or easiest to program and so on.  \\nNow, suppose we have to multiply two positive integers using only pencil and paper.  \\nClassical multiplication algorithm: \\nIn North America, they use the American approach of multiplication and in England they use \\nEnglish multiplication approach.', '7 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\nǎ la russe approach:', '8 | P a g e  \\nDivide and conquer approach of multiplication:  \\n• Both the multiplicand and the multiplier must have the same number of digits and this \\nnumber be a power of 2.  \\n• If not then it can be done by adding zeros on the left if necessary. \\n \\nThe multiplication of two four-digit numbers is reduced to four multiplications of two-digit \\nnumbers.  \\nAgain, 2 two-digit numbers’ multiplication is given as follows: \\nMultiply Shift Result \\n0 * 1 2 00 \\n0 * 2 1   0 \\n9 * 1 1 90 \\n9 * 2 0 18 \\n  108 \\n \\nEach of the above, two-digit multiplication is done using same way with some shifts and \\naddition.  \\nLater, we will see how we can reduce the multiplication from four to three  in divide and \\nconquer approach . With these improvements , divide and conquer approach runs faster on \\ncomputer than any of the preceding methods.', '9 | P a g e', '10 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nCHAPTER – 2  Asymptotic \\nNotations and Analysis', \"11 | P a g e  \\n2.1 Asymptotic Notations \\nThe running time of an algorithm depends on how long it takes a computer to run the lines of  \\ncode of the algorithm —and that depends on the speed of the computer, the programming \\nlanguage, and the compiler that translates the program from the programming language into \\ncode that runs directly on the computer, among other factors. \\nLet's think about the running time of an algorithm more carefully. We can use a combination \\nof two ideas.  First, we need to determine how long the algorithm takes, in terms of the size \\nof its input.  In case of linear search, number of comparisons are increased when number o f \\nelements are increased. So, we think about the running time of the algorithm as a  function of \\nthe size of its input. \\nSecond, an idea is that we must focus on how fast a function grows with the input size. We \\ncall this the  rate of growth of the running time. To keep things manageable, we need to \\nsimplify the function to extract the most important part and ignore the less important parts. \\nFor example, suppose that an algorithm, running on an input of size  n, takes 6 n2 + 100 n + \\n300. The 6 n2 term becomes larger than the remaining terms 100 n + 300 When n becomes \\nlarge enough, 20 in this case.  \\n \\nWe would say that the running time of this algorithm grows as n 2, dropping the coefficient 6 \\nand the remaining terms 100 n + 300.  \\nIt doesn't really matter what coefficients we use; as long as the running time an2 + bn + c, for \\nsome numbers a > 0, b, and c, there will always be a value of n for which  an2 is greater \\nthan bn + c and this difference increases as  n increases. For example,  here's a chart showing \\nvalues of 0.6 n2 + 1000n+3000, where we reduced the coefficient of n 2 by a factor of 10 and \\nincreased the other two constants by a factor of 10.\", \"12 | P a g e  \\n \\nBy dropping the less significant terms and the constant coefficients, we can focus on the \\nimportant part of an algorithm's running time —its rate of growth —. When we drop the \\nconstant coefficients and the less significant terms, we use asymptotic notation. \\nAnother example of growth rate: \\nThe order of function growth is critical in evaluating the algorithm’s performance. Assume \\nthe running times of two algorithms A and B are f(n) and g(n), respectively. \\nf(n) = 2n2 + 5                                 \\ng(n) = 10n \\nHere, n represents the size of the problem, while polynomials f(n) and g(n) represent the \\nnumber of basic operations performed by algorithms A and B, respectively. Running time of \\nboth the functions for different input size is shown in following table: \\nn 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \\nf(n) – A 7 13 23 37 55 77 103 \\ng(n) – B 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 \\n \\nAlgorithm A may outperform algorithm B for small input sizes, however when input sizes \\nbecome sufficiently big (in this example n = 5), f(n) always runs slower (performs more \\nsteps) than g(n). As a result, understanding the growth rate of functions is crit ical. \\nAsymptotic notations describe the function’s limiting behaviour.  \\nWhat is asymptotic notation?  \\nAsymptotic notations are a mathematical tool that can be used to determine the time or space \\ncomplexity of an algorithm without having to implement it in a programming language. This \\nmeasure is unaffected by machine -specific constants. It is a way of describing a significant \\npart of the cost of the algorithm.\", '13 | P a g e  \\nMachine-specific constants include the machine’s hardware architecture, RAM, supported \\nvirtual memory, processor speed, available instruction set (RISC or CISC), and so on.  The \\nasymptotic notations examine algorithms that are not affected by any of these above factors. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen doing complexity analysis, the following assumptions are assumed. \\nAssumptions for finding the growth rate:  \\n\\uf0a7 The actual cost of operation is not considered. \\n\\uf0a7 Abstract cost c is ignored: O(c. n2) reduces to O(n2) \\n\\uf0a7 Only leading term of a polynomial is considered: O(n3 + n) reduces to O(n3) \\n\\uf0a7 Drop multiplicative or divisive constant if any: O(2n2) and O(n2/2) both reduces \\nto O(n2). \\n \\n \\nThere are mainly three asymptotic notations: \\n\\uf0b7 Big-O notation – upper bound of the function  \\n\\uf0b7 Omega notation - lower bound of the function \\n\\uf0b7 Theta notation – average bound of the function.', '14 | P a g e  \\n2.2  Big- O notation: \\nWe write f(n) = O(g(n)), If there are positive constants n 0 and c such that, to the right of n 0 \\nthe f(n) always lies on or below c*g(n). \\nO(g(n)) = { f(n) : There exist positive constant c and n 0 such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ c g(n), for all n ≥ \\nn0} \\n \\nFor example: \\nf(n) = 2 n + 3 \\n2 n + 3 < =  ????  \\n2 n + 3 < = 10 n for any value of n > no, no =1 and c = 10.  \\nWe can write anything like 7 n, 1000 n.  \\nSimply, we can do the following. \\n2 n + 3 <= 2 n + 3 n \\n2 n + 3 < = 5 n , n >=1 \\nHere, f(n) = 2 n + 3 and g(n) = n  \\nSo, f(n) = O(g(n))  \\nCan we write the following? \\n2 n + 3 <= 2 n2 + 3 n2  \\nYes, we can also write and f(n) = O(n2)  \\nf(n) = O(n) , f(n) = O(n2)  \\nActually, f(n) belongs to linear class and all the classes on its right are upper bound of it.

Worst Case Analysis (Mostly used)  \\nIn the worst -case analysis, we calculate the upper bound on the running time of an \\nalgorithm. We must know the case that causes a maximum number of operations to be \\nexecuted. For Line ar Search, the worst case happens when the element to be searched (x) is \\nnot present in the array. When x is not present, the search()  function compares it with all \\nthe elements of arr[] one by one. Therefore, the worst -case time complexity of the linear \\nsearch would be O(n). \\n \\n2. Best Case Analysis (Very Rarely used)  \\nIn the best-case analysis, we calculate the lower bound on the running time of an algorithm. \\nWe must know the case that causes a minimum number of operations to be executed. In the', '23 | P a g e  \\nlinear sear ch problem, the best case occurs when x is present at the first location. The \\nnumber of operations in the best case is constant (not dependent on n). So time complexity \\nin the best case would be Ω(1)  or O(1).  \\n \\n3. Average Case Analysis (Rarely used)  \\nIn average case analysis, we take all possible inputs and calculate the computing time for \\nall of the inputs. Sum all the calculated values and divide the sum by the total number of \\ninputs. We must know (or predict) the distribution of cases. For the linear s earch problem, \\nlet us assume that all cases are  uniformly distributed (including the case of x not being \\npresent in the array). So, we sum all the cases and divide  the sum by n which is O(n).  \\n \\nCase analysis is identifying instances for which the algorithm takes the longest  or shortest \\ntime to complete (i.e., takes the greatest number of steps), then formulating a growth function \\nusing this. \\n \\nLet’s understand them using two examples to find their best, worst and average case.  \\nExamples: \\n1.

When the searched key is present \\non the index 0 (first) then it is best case. Time taken by this is constant time – B(n) = O(1).  \\nWorst case: When algorithm takes maximum time. When searched key is present at last \\nindex.

Then feasible \\nsolutions are only Train and plane means they are satisfying the constraints.  \\nMinimum cost of travelling from A to B that is minimization problem.  \\nIf we go by train, then it will have minimum cost of travelling and it is called optimal \\nsolution (which is achieving the objective of the problem).  \\nAn optimal solution is a feasible solution that results in the largest possible objective function \\nvalue when maximizing (or smallest when minimizing). \\nThe following methods are used to solve the optimization problem: \\n1. Greedy  \\n2. Branch and Bound \\n3. Dynamic Programming \\nGreedy Method:  \\nThe Greedy method is the simplest and straightforward approach. It is not an algorithm, but it \\nis a technique. The main function of this approach is that the decision is taken on the basis of \\nthe currently available information. Whatever the current information is present, the decision \\nis made without worrying about the effect of the current decision in future. \\nThis technique is basically used to determine the feasible solution that may or may not be \\noptimal. The feasible solution is a subset that satisfies the given criteri a. The optimal solution \\nis the solution which is the best and the most favorable solution in the subset. In the case of \\nfeasible, if more than one solution satisfies the given criteria then those solutions will be \\nconsidered as feasible, whereas the optima l solution is the best solution among all the \\nsolutions. \\nThe greedy method solves the problem into stages. In each stage it considers one input and \\nchecks whether it is feasible or not. If it is feasible then add it to the list of feasible solutions.  \\nSuppose we are given any problem A having list of inputs: n = 5.  \\nA1 A2 A3 A4 A5', \"112 | P a g e  \\nIn general, we can use following algorithm for solving any problem using greedy method.  \\nAlgorithm Greedy(A, n)  \\n{  \\n for(i=1;i<=n;i++) \\n      { \\n  x = select(A); \\n  if (x is feasible) \\n     Solution = Solution + x; \\n                    } \\n             return Solution; \\n  } \\nAdvantages of Greedy Approach \\n\\uf0b7 The algorithm is easier to describe. \\n\\uf0b7 This algorithm can perform better than other algorithms (but, not in all cases). \\nDrawback of Greedy Approach \\n\\uf0b7 As mentioned earlier, the greedy algorithm doesn't always produce the optimal \\nsolution. This is the major disadvantage of the algorithm. \\nFor example, suppose we want to find the longest path in the graph below from root to leaf. \\nLet's use the greedy algorithm here.\", \"113 | P a g e  \\nGreedy Approach \\n1. Let's start with the root node 20. The weight of the right child is 3 and the weight of the left \\nchild is 2. \\n2. Our problem is to find the largest path. And the optimal solution at the moment is 3. So, \\nthe greedy algorithm will choose 3. \\n3. Finally the weight of an only child of 3 is 1. This gives us our final result 20 + 3 + 1 = 24. \\nHowever, it is not the optimal solution. There is another path that carries more weight (20 + 2 \\n+ 10 = 32) \\n \\nWe follow some known method of solving the problem that is Greedy method.  \\nExamples: \\n1.

If we have to select the best candidate for job out of 1000 then we do conduct \\nwritten test, GD, PI and select the best candidate. It may not be the best.

Suppose we have given some items which have \\nsome weights or profits. We have to put some items in the knapsack in such a way total value \\nproduces a maximum profit. \\nFor example, the weight of the  container is 20 kg. We have to select the items in such a way \\nthat the sum of the weight of items should be either smaller than or equal to the weight of the \\ncontainer, and the profit should be maximum. \\nThere are two types of knapsack problems: \\no 0/1 knapsack problem \\no Fractional knapsack problem \\nWhat is the 0/1 knapsack problem? \\nThe 0/1 knapsack problem means that the items are either completely or no items are filled in \\na knapsack. For example, we have two items having weights 2kg and 3kg, respectively. If we \\npick the 2kg item, then we cannot pick 1kg item from the 2kg item (item is not divisible); we \\nhave to pick the 2kg item completely. This is a 0/1 knapsack problem in which either we pick \\nthe item completely or we will pick that item.

Wherever we see a \\nrecursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic \\nProgramming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to \\nre-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from \\nexponential to polynomial. \\nThere are two main approaches to dynamic programming: \\nTop-down approach (Memorization):  \\nIn computer science, problems are resolved by recursively formulating solutions, employing \\nthe answers to the problems’ subproblems. If the answers to the subproblems overlap, they \\nmay be memorized or kept in a table for later use. The top -down approach fo llows the \\nstrategy of memorization. The memorization process is equivalent to adding the recursion \\nand caching steps. The difference between recursion and caching is that recursion requires \\ncalling the function directly, whereas caching requires preserving the intermediate results. \\nThe top-down strategy has many benefits, including the following: \\n1. The top -down approach is easy to understand and implement. In this approach, \\nproblems are broken down into smaller parts, which help users identify what needs to \\nbe done. With each step, more significant, more complex problems become smaller, \\nless complicated, and, therefore, easier to solve. Some parts may even be reusable for \\nthe same problem. \\n2. It allows for subproblems to be solved upon request. The top -down appro ach will \\nenable problems to be broken down into smaller parts and their solutions stored for \\nreuse. Users can then query solutions for each part.  \\n3. It is also easier to debug. Segmenting problems into small parts allows users to follow \\nthe solution quickly and determine where an error might have occurred.  \\nDisadvantages of the top-down approach include: \\n1. The top-down approach uses the recursion technique, which occupies more memory \\nin the call stack. This leads to reduced overall performance. Additionally, wh en the \\nrecursion is too deep, a stack overflow occurs.  \\nBottom-up approach (Tabulation): \\nIn the bottom-up method, once a solution to a problem is written in terms of its subproblems \\nin a way that loops back on itself, users can rewrite the problem by solvi ng the smaller \\nsubproblems first and then using their solutions to solve the larger subproblems.  \\nUnlike the top-down approach, the bottom-up approach removes the recursion. Thus, there is \\nneither stack overflow nor overhead from the recursive functions. I t also allows for saving \\nmemory space. Removing recursion decreases the time complexity of recursion due to \\nrecalculating the same values.', '138 | P a g e  \\nThe advantages of the bottom-up approach include the following: \\n1. It makes decisions about small reusable subproblems and then decides how they will \\nbe put together to create a large problem.  \\n2. It removes recursion, thus promoting the efficient use of memory space. Additionally, \\nthis also leads to a reduction in timing complexity.  \\nWhen one can apply dynamic programing to solve the problem?  \\nDynamic programming solves complex problems by breaking them up into smaller ones \\nusing recursion and storing the answers, so they don’t have to be worked out again. It isn’t \\npractical when there aren’t any problems that overlap because it doesn’t make sense to store \\nsolutions to the issues that won’t be needed again. \\nTwo main signs are that one can solve a problem with dynam ic programming: subproblems \\nthat overlap and the best possible substructure. \\nOverlapping subproblems \\nWhen the answers to the same subproblem are needed more than once to solve the main \\nproblem, we say that the subproblems overlap. In overlapping issues, so lutions are put into a \\ntable so developers can use them repeatedly instead of recalculating them. The recursive \\nprogram for the Fibonacci numbers has several subproblems that overlap, but a binary search \\ndoesn’t have any subproblems that overlap. \\nA binary search is solved using the divide and conquer technique. Every time, the \\nsubproblems have a unique array to find the value. Thus, binary search lacks the overlapping \\nproperty.  \\nFor example, when finding the nth Fibonacci number, the problem F(n) is broken down into \\nfinding F(n-1) and F. (n -2). You can break down F(n -1) even further into a subproblem that \\nhas to do with F. (n -2). In this scenario, F(n -2) is reused, and thus, the F ibonacci sequence \\ncan be said to exhibit overlapping properties.  \\nOptimal substructure:  \\nThe optimal substructure property of a problem says that you can find the best answer to the \\nproblem by taking the best solutions to its subproblems and putting them t ogether. (Optimal \\nsolution to a problem contains an optimal solution of the sub problems.) \\nThis property is not exclusive to dynamic programming alone, as several problems consist of \\noptimal substructures. However, most of them lack overlapping issues. So, they can’t be \\nsolved with dynamic programming. \\nWhat is the difference between Optimal Substructure and Overlapping Subproblems? \\nIn optimal substructure, we use the optimal answer of the subproblems to find the optimal \\nanswer for a bigger problem. Whereas in Overlapping subproblems we store the answer for \\nthe Overlapping subproblems so that we d on’t have to re -compute the answer for the same \\nsubproblem again.', '139 | P a g e  \\nFor example: \\nThe following example demonstrates the optimal substructure property for the path finding \\nproblem.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Shortest path problem exhibits optimal substructure property: \\nS(A,D) = S(A,E) + S(E,D) \\nThe shortest path from A to E and E to D gives the shortest path A to D. So, sub problem’s \\noptimal solution gives optimal solution of the problem.  \\n\\uf0b7 Longest path problem does not exhibit optimal substructure property:  \\nL(A, C) = L(A,D) + (D,C) \\nThere are two possible path from A to C: one is ( A, B), (B, C) and another is (A,E), (E,D), \\n(D,C). The second one gives the longest path.  \\n             = (A, E), (E, D), (D,C) +  (D,C) \\nIf we add this path to the edge ( D,C), there would be a repeating edge, i.e., D to C which is \\nnot allowed. So, in this case, the sub -solutions to a problem do not combine to form the \\noverall optimal solution. Therefore, we can say that the Longest -path problem does not \\nexhibit an Optimal substructure. \\n \\nProblems which can be solved using dynamic programming:  \\nThe technique is widely used to solve problems in various domains, such as optimization \\nproblems, combinatorial problems, grap h algorithms, and more. Classic examples of \\nproblems solved using dynamic programming include the Fibonacci sequence, the knapsack \\nproblem, shortest paths in graphs (e.g., Floyd -Warshall algorithm), and longest common \\nsubsequence, among others. \\nFirst, we need to clear the difference between Greedy method and Dynamic Programming. \\nBoth are used to solve optimization problems. Optimization problems are those which need \\nminimum or maximum result.  \\n \\nA \\nE \\nB C \\nD', '140 | P a g e  \\nGreedy Method Dynamic Programming \\nWe try to follow the predefined procedure. \\nBut the procedure to be known to the \\noptimum.  \\nWe try to find all the possible solutions and \\nthen pick the best solution.

When the mismatch occurs, we shift one character in text and reset \\nthe pattern string from the beginning.  \\nThe running time of the naïve approach is O(m * n).  \\nLet see the concepts  of prefix and suffix  before we procced for the mechanism of KMP \\nalgorithm.  \\nA B C D A B C \\nPrefix: Any valid subset of the string from left to right.

Simply, we are \\nchecking that beginning part of the pattern is appearing again in the text or not so, we have a \\nsmaller number of comparisons unlike naïve approach.

We start our search from any arbitrary vertex say 'a.' This vertex 'a' becomes the \\nroot of our implicit  tree. The first element of our partial solution is the first intermediate \\nvertex of the Hamiltonian Cycle that is to be constructed. The next adjacent vertex is selected \\nby alphabetical order. If at any stage any arbitrary vertex makes a cycle with any ve rtex other \\nthan vertex 'a' then we say that dead end is reached. In this case, we backtrack one step, and \\nagain the search begins by selecting another vertex and backtrack the element from the \\npartial; solution must be removed. The search using backtrackin g is successful if a \\nHamiltonian Cycle is obtained. \\nTime Complexity : O(N!), where N is number of vertices. \\nExample: Consider a graph G = (V, E) shown in fig. we have to find a Hamiltonian circuit \\nusing Backtracking method.\"]\n"

Optimal Substructure: Number of ways to make sum at index i, i.e., count(i, sum, coins), depends on the optimal solutions of the subproblems count(i, sum-coins[i-1], coins) , and count(i-1, sum, coins). By adding these optimal substructures, we can efficiently calculate the number of ways to make target ... [Naive Approach ] Using Recursion - O(n^sum) Time and O(sum) Space. This problem is a variation of the problem Coin Change Problem.Here instead of finding the total number of possible solutions, we need to find the solution with the minimum number of coins.. The idea is to find the minimum number of coins required to reach the target sum by trying each coin denomination in the coins[] array. The Coin Change Problem involves finding the number of ways to make change for a given amount using a set of coin denominations. Example: Consider an integer array coins[] representing different coin denominations and an integer amount, determine the number of combinations of coins that sum up to the given amount. In this HackerRank The Coin Change Problem solution you have given an amount and the denominations of coins available, determine how many ways change can be made for amount. There is a limitless supply of each coin type. Problem solution in Python. ... Problem solution in C. Say that C(i, j) is the answer to the (i, j) problem. Now, consider an instance (i, j). We have to decide whether or not we are using one of the a_i coins. If we are not, we are just solving a (i + 1, j) problem and the answer is C(i + 1, j). If we are, we complete the solution by making change for j - a_i.'"
