From everyday decisions, such as deciding daily outfits\\n[1, 2], to high-risk sectors such as healthcare [3, 4, 5, 6] and investment [7, 8], AI\\ncan aid humans in accomplishing a myriad of tasks. However, recent studies found\\nthat the effectiveness of human-AI teams often does not surpass that of AI operating\\nalone, primarily because humans might follow AI’s incorrect advice, despite having\\nthe capability to make superior judgments independently [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In fact,\\nthe efficacy of human-AI collaboration is conditioned on many factors, one of which is\\nthe human ability to accurately assess when AI’s guidance is dependable and when it\\nmight falter, thus calibrating their trust accordingly [14, 15, 16, 17]. Trust calibration\\nin human-AI collaboration refers to the process by which a person adjusts their trust\\nto match the actual reliability and trustworthiness of the AI system[16, 14]. Adequate\\nsupport for trust calibration enables humans to utilize AI judiciously–leveraging it\\nwhen it is reliable and refraining from using it when it is not. Conversely, excessive\\ntrust in AI, or overtrust, can lead to its misuse by relying on it in unreliable scenarios.\\nSimilarly, insufficient trust, ordistrust, results in the disuse of AI, even in instances\\nwhere AI could offer more reliable advice than human judgment [15, 16].\\nRecent studies show that improving AI transparency by disclosing its uncertainty\\nlevels can help humans calibrate trust towards AI and improve human decision-making\\nabout AI use, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration [18, 19, 20, 21, 13].\\nAn effective approach to conveying AI uncertainty is expression of confidence, which\\nestimate the probability of AI making correct decision, i.e., correctness likelihood [19].\\nClassification models, for instance, can yield a')]"

      "Summary: The development of quantum computers is a major goal of quantum physics and computer science. Here, we report a programmable quantum computer that can execute a wide range of algorithms and has been tested to demonstrate quantum supremacy, solving a problem that is beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers.\n",

      "Summary: Quantum error correction is essential for large-scale quantum computing, but current methods are often inefficient or require complex encoding procedures. Here, we show that bosonic codes, which encode quantum information in the excitations of harmonic oscillators, can provide a powerful and flexible approach to quantum error correction.\n",

      "title: AI Thinking: A framework for rethinking artificial intelligence in practice\n",
      "authors: Denis Newman-Griffis\n",
      "summary: Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information across disciplines and practical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are now involved in studying, developing, and assessing the use of AI in practice, but these disciplines often employ conflicting understandings of what AI is and what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge competing conceptualisations of AI in practice and help shape the future of AI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. The AI Thinking model addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context: motivating AI use in information processes, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools and technologies, selecting appropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is used in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI Thinking in practice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, including its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. AI Thinking can help to bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse contexts of AI use, and to reshape the future of AI in practice.\n",

      "title: Intersymbolic AI: Interlinking Symbolic AI and Subsymbolic AI\n",
      "authors: André Platzer\n",
      "summary: This perspective piece calls for the study of the new field of Intersymbolic AI, by which we mean the combination of symbolic AI, whose building blocks have inherent significance/meaning, with subsymbolic AI, whose entirety creates significance/effect despite the fact that individual building blocks escape meaning. Canonical kinds of symbolic AI are logic, games and planning. Canonical kinds of subsymbolic AI are (un)supervised machine and reinforcement learning. Intersymbolic AI interlinks the worlds of symbolic AI with its compositional symbolic significance and meaning and of subsymbolic AI with its summative significance or effect to enable culminations of insights from both worlds by going between and across symbolic AI insights with subsymbolic AI techniques that are being helped by symbolic AI principles. For example, Intersymbolic AI may start with symbolic AI to understand a dynamic system, continue with subsymbolic AI to learn its control, and end with symbolic AI to safely use the outcome of the learned subsymbolic AI controller in the dynamic system. The way Intersymbolic AI combines both symbolic and subsymbolic AI to increase the effectiveness of AI compared to either kind of AI alone is likened to the way that the combination of both conscious and subconscious thought increases the effectiveness of human thought compared to either kind of thought alone. Some successful contributions to the Intersymbolic AI paradigm are surveyed here but many more are considered possible by advancing Intersymbolic AI.\n",

      "title: Overconfident and Unconfident AI Hinder Human-AI Collaboration\n",
      "authors: Jingshu Li, Yitian Yang, Renwen Zhang, Yi-chieh Lee\n",
      "summary: AI transparency is a central pillar of responsible AI deployment and effective human-AI collaboration. A critical approach is communicating uncertainty, such as displaying AI's confidence level, or its correctness likelihood (CL), to users. However, these confidence levels are often uncalibrated, either overestimating or underestimating actual CL, posing risks and harms to human-AI collaboration. This study examines the effects of uncalibrated AI confidence on users' trust in AI, AI advice adoption, and collaboration outcomes. We further examined the impact of increased transparency, achieved through trust calibration support, on these outcomes. Our results reveal that uncalibrated AI confidence leads to both the misuse of overconfident AI and disuse of unconfident AI, thereby hindering outcomes of human-AI collaboration. Deficiency of trust calibration support exacerbates this issue by making it harder to detect uncalibrated confidence, promoting misuse and disuse of AI. Conversely, trust calibration support aids in recognizing uncalibration and reducing misuse, but it also fosters distrust and causes disuse of AI. Our findings highlight the importance of AI confidence calibration for enhancing human-AI collaboration and suggest directions for AI design and regulation.\n",
